Contour & filled contour plots
Although plt.imshow() or plt.pcolor() are often used to visualize a 2-D array in entirety, there are other ways of visualizing such data without displaying all the available sample values. One option is to use the array to compute contours that are visualized instead.

Two types of contour plot supported by Matplotlib are plt.contour() and plt.contourf() where the former displays the contours as lines and the latter displayed filled areas between contours. Both these plotting commands accept a two dimensional array from which the appropriate contours are computed.

In this exercise, you will visualize a 2-D array repeatedly using both plt.contour() and plt.contourf(). You will use 

# Generate a default contour map of the array Z
plt.subplot(2,2,1)
plt.contour(X, Y, Z)

# Generate a contour map with 20 contours
plt.subplot(2,2,2)
plt.contour(X, Y, Z, 20)

# Generate a default filled contour map of the array Z
plt.subplot(2,2,3)
plt.contourf(X, Y, Z)

# Generate a default filled contour map with 20 contours
plt.subplot(2,2,4)
plt.contourf(X, Y, Z, 20)

# Improve the spacing between subplots
plt.tight_layout()

# Display the figure
plt.show()
