Generating meshes
In order to visualize two-dimensional arrays of data, it is necessary to understand how to generate and manipulate 2-D arrays. Many Matplotlib plots support arrays as input and in particular, they support NumPy arrays. The NumPy library is the most widely-supported means for supporting numeric arrays in Python.

In this exercise, you will use the meshgrid function in NumPy to generate 2-D arrays which you will then visualize using plt.imshow(). The simplest way to generate a meshgrid is as follows:

# Import numpy and matplotlib.pyplot
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate two 1-D arrays: u, v
u = np.linspace(-2, 2, 41)
v = np.linspace(-1, 1, 21)

# Generate 2-D arrays from u and v: X, Y
X,Y = np.meshgrid(u,v)

# Compute Z based on X and Y
Z = np.sin(3*np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)) 

# Display the resulting image with pcolor()
plt.pcolor(Z)
plt.show()

# Save the figure to 'sine_mesh.png'
plt.savefig('sine_mesh.png')
