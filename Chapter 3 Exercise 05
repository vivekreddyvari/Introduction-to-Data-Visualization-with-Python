Grouping linear regressions by row or column
Rather than overlaying linear regressions of grouped data in the same plot, we may want to use a grid of subplots. The sns.lmplot() accepts the arguments row and/or col to arrangements of subplots for regressions.

You'll use the automobile dataset again and, this time, you'll use the keyword argument row to display the subplots organized in rows. That is, you'll produce horsepower vs. weight regressions grouped by continent of origin in separate subplots stacked vertically.

# Plot linear regressions between 'weight' and 'hp' grouped row-wise by 'origin'
sns.lmplot(x='weight', y='hp', data=auto,col='origin')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
